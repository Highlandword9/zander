# zander
Zander is a Minecraft plugin that I use as an Administration tool for my Minecraft Servers.
The main goal of the Zander project is to allow me to learn Java and the Spigot library.

## Addon

An addon that is in Development is a web server side to integrate with the MySQL database.

## Features
#### Jukebox Radio
The jukebox radio comes with the /jukebox command `zander.jukebox` will open a GUI where you can select and play any disc that is currently in the game. Personally, I have been using this with a custom resource pack and putting other music over it.

#### Rotten Flesh to Leather
It basically explains it all in the title, a simple recipe added to allow users to smelt Rotten Flesh to Leather, to give it more purpose.

#### End Void Safety
If a player is to jump or fall into the void, they will be teleported back to the overworld to either the world spawn or their spawn point and die.

#### Ender Dragon Death Display
On the death of the Ender Dragon, a public message will be broadcasted to all players (in that chat) and the killer will get a title screen message (as shown in the GIF).
