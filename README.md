# zander
## Notice
This version of zander is reaching an EOL [End of Life] stage. Zander in this repo can only with stand one server, and not multiple networked servers (like in the use of BungeeCord). This plugin is currently under redevelopment to be used with BungeeCord so things will be changing.

All information about zander and it's components can be found on [documentation site](https://zanderdocs.benrobson.me).
